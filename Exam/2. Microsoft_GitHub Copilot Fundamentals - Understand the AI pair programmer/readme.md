  *Explanation:* Copilot uses more than just the prompt text for suggestions.  

- ❌ **It considers the file type but not the content of the file.**  
  *Explanation:* Copilot analyzes both the file type and its content.  

- ✅ **It considers the surrounding code, file type, and content of parallel open tabs in the code editor.**  
  *Explanation:* GitHub Copilot uses the broader context, including adjacent code and open files, to provide relevant suggestions.  
  [Learn more here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot/how-github-copilot-works).  

- ❌ **It randomly selects context from the internet.**  
  *Explanation:* Copilot does not randomly select content from the internet.  

---

#### **7. Which of these strategies helps to improve prompt effectiveness in GitHub Copilot?**  
- ✅ **Providing detailed contextual information with clarity.**  
  *Explanation:* Clear, detailed prompts improve the accuracy and relevance of suggestions from Copilot.  
  [Learn more here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot/working-with-prompts).  

- ❌ **Making the prompt as general as possible.**  
  *Explanation:* General prompts lead to vague or less useful suggestions.  

- ❌ **Keeping the prompt lengthy and detailed.**  
  *Explanation:* Length is less important than clarity and precision.  

- ❌ **Avoiding examples in the prompt to not restrict Copilot's creativity.**  
  *Explanation:* Including examples often improves Copilot's responses.

#### **1. What is ghost text in GitHub Copilot?**  
- ✅ **Ghost text in GitHub Copilot are suggestions that appear in your text editor as you type.**  
  *Explanation:* Ghost text provides real-time code suggestions as you write, appearing as dimmed text that can be accepted or ignored.  
  [Learn more here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot-in-visual-studio-code#ghost-text-suggestions).  

- ❌ **Ghost text in GitHub Copilot are options used when typing to provide suggestions.**  
  *Explanation:* This is incorrect because ghost text is not about providing options; it is directly displayed in the editor.  

- ❌ **Ghost text in GitHub Copilot involves using prompts and natural language questions within your code or documentation.**
